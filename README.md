# AI_Testing
This repository holds scripts used in a AI testing scene, AI testing is a small project focused on learning more about combat AI and how to create an easy to implement AI system.

Part of the script system is the usage of keywords that denote what each script does--
CS: combat style controls how an AI will attack its target and allows that AI to make use of other combat related functions.
SA: special attacks allows an AI to use certain attack combos or abilities related to its CS type.
DI: damage interaction changes how an AIs attack interacts with targets and the enviorment.
MT: movement type controls how an AI will move around the world and how to moves to interact with targets
ME: maneuverers allows a movement type to use special movement interactions while in combat
